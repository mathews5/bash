# naming convention
# Class names start with an uppercase letter and all other with a lowercase letter
# Starting an identifier with a single leading undersocre indicates by convention that the identifier is meant to be private
# Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier
# If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defiend special name

# Python use identation to indicate blocks of code 

# Multi-line statements
# total = a + \
